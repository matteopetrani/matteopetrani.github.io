excerpt: "Why the value of design lies in the strategy and humanity that governs the tools, not in the tools themselves."

Let's set sail! First post, packaged before going to grandma's for lunch.

If you've heard me talk about design in recent years, you'll know that I often repeat one thing: any digital platform delivered via pixels is now a commodity 🤷‍♂️ .

So are the e-commerce sites that spring up like mushrooms, the apps that replicate existing services, the trading platforms that all look alike. Even the design disciplines related to the mere technical realization of the product crumble in this scenario.

Today, with tools like v0, Replit or Copilot, prototyping a SaaS is a matter of prompts (more or less complex). The technicalities of the "container" matter less and less to the end user. So where is the value? In the content. In the strategy that governs it. In asking myself uncomfortable questions:

> "Am I solving an authentic problem?"

> "Is there any substance in what I create?"

In a famous essay entitled The Question Concerning Technology, Martin Heidegger observed how technology can become a "Gestell" (or "enframing"): a structure that tends to reduce the world to a mere resource, subordinating man rather than serving him. This perspective finds a very current echo in many digital scenarios where the race for innovation translates into a multiplication of features and platforms, often devoid of an authentic reflection on the meaning of what is produced.

LLMs? Phenomenal tools, of course. It would be hypocritical (and uneconomical for my clients) to ignore them. ChatGPT analyzes business scenarios, generates use cases and outlines design strategies in seconds. You're welcome.

But the point is not what we use to connect the dots - whether it's a blackboard, an Excel sheet, a Miro board or a chat with AI - but why we do it.

As Jaron Lanier (pioneer of virtual reality and critic of digital platforms) points out, we risk "dissolving" human authenticity in algorithms that replicate and redistribute content. On the one hand, this empowers us; on the other, it leads us to wonder if we are actually designing reality or passively submitting to an infinity of equivalent services.

Here is our duty today: to accept that man is at the service of technology, but to protect with our nails the human uniqueness of our work. That made of:

- Awareness (not of data)
- Balance (not of optimizations)
- Kindness (not of engagement)

> Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, has repeatedly stressed that social platforms are designed to capture our attention at all costs, while what we really need is a design that privileges respect and care for relationships.

This triad will never be codable. It is the antidote to toxic business models, to products that trap us, to services that forget to serve.

## Rethinking value

When everything seems to be reduced to a sterile "pixel container", the real value arises from a deeper understanding of the context, of the people, of why a certain service is created. In this sense, Donald Norman taught us to always start from the human being (Human-Centered Design), and Shoshana Zuboff warns us of the risks of surveillance capitalism, reminding us that design is not only form or usability, but above all consequences and responsibility.

## Let's sum up

Whether it's an e-commerce, an app or a new LLM, the value does not lie in the technical application itself, but in its ability to solve real problems and to do so in a conscious, balanced and kind way.
Our superpower? Designing beyond the machine. And to do so, we must master the tools (from the most traditional to the most futuristic), but also constantly cultivate a critical, ethical, social and existential reflection.

This is the biggest challenge: to combine the power of innovation with the depth of thought. Only in this way can we ensure that we create products and services that are not simply another digital "commodity", but something that reflects and enhances the essence of the human being.
