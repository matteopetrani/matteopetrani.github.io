Is it right to convince ourselves that the time spent in front of a Mac is "right"? I've been wondering about this for a while, especially in these weeks that I've started "producing" again. I try to give this time a shape, a purpose. Meanwhile, outside, nature lives its course.

There is a heritage in our life that we cannot invest, we cannot increase in any way and indeed, it is a source from which we can only withdraw and of which we do not even know the exact amount: the time at our disposal.

Anxiety? Take comfort, it is a law imposed by life from which no one can escape.

"If the problem cannot be solved, why worry?"
— Dalai Lama

I've been working for 15 years to design digital experiences and "screen time" has always been an ambiguous KPI: some want to increase it to increase Time-Weighted Revenue, others want to decrease it as evidence of an extremely optimized product.

I've always liked the line by Willie Peyote: "We all want to save time, and then what do we do with this extra time? Bah.". How true is that? It is also true that having free time is the starting point for being able to use it with your head. All the concepts of making space, of freeing, of emptying to allow something else to enter our lives come back to the surface. Maybe we'll talk about this in the future.

Starting from these assumptions, I started writing a small manifesto. It is a draft open to feedback and suggestions; in the meantime, I'll share a WIP with you.

There are only 4 points for now, I plan to extend it to be more inclusive of other aspects of life.

The 4 principles can be summarized as follows:

 1. Every living being is free and as such chooses how to use their vital time.
 2. Wherever possible, reduce or eliminate any duty necessary for survival
 3. Innovation and technology must take charge of all the duties and obligations for the individual coming from society, economy, politics
 4. Any product or service must be born from a thought of love

Would you add others?

## Let's rethink time

We live in an era where everything is measured except for the time that passes. In this flowing stream we must, in order to live, submit to imposed duties and social obligations.

I have often wondered what would happen if we could regain control of it. This design manifesto was born as an invitation to redefine our relationship with time, reaffirming the right of every living being to choose how to invest every moment of their existence. In order not to create distortions in this vision, every product and service is not only functional, but should be born from a thought of love and unity, putting the well-being of the individual at the center.

Rethinking time means designing a world in which life is not marked by obligations, but by conscious choices.

And you, how would you like to use your time?
