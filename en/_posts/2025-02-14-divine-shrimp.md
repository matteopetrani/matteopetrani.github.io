excerpt: "In the ocean of synthetic content, the only defense is a human, honest and slow voice that protects the time and quality of what we create."

A not very "physical" and very "mental" week: countless reasonings on data, on the optimization of e-commerce and, of course, strategic thoughts on how and why to sell AI. But above all, a thousand ideas for SaaS to develop.

Everyone stand up, together! Inhale, and on my 3, out loud:

Ok, it's done, you can sit down now.

I know, I know, it's a plague we have to live with: posts written by a hastily prompted LLM. On LinkedIn you can spot them easily: the emojis at the beginning of each paragraph, the five takeaways at the end of the post, the sensationalism for every little concept, the didactic Italian and the impeccable punctuation. But, above all, it is the question marks and the impeccable use of subjunctives that make me have doubts. Confess: when was the last time you used them in a message?

Leaving our feeds and looking at the big picture, the most aware have already noticed for a few years that quality content is behind a paywall and that, outside of it, we often find meatballs of synthetic or other people's content, revisited to tickle the ranking and newsfeed algorithm.

## BEEP – BOOP – BZZZT!

To date, 57% of online content is generated by AI or bots, which account for about 50% of total traffic. Of these, over 30% are bad bots - whether they are servers used for more or less legal purposes or the like farms that titillate our vanity metrics.

In March 2024, Google put its foot down: "We will no longer reward sites that write for search engines! We will reward those with genuine content, written by and for people!". In fact, more than half of online content is synthetic and, as GenAI models become more and more performing, the more Turing will turn in his grave.

But how did we get here? There is a beautiful conspiracy theory, the Dead Internet Theory, which warns us: the contents on the Internet are mostly created by bots and manipulated by algorithms, in order to control people and minimize the organic ones, created by man. We will never know the truth, but there is also another interesting point of view: we got here because AI models are tremendously hungry for content.

## Everyone at the table

The menu is tasty but does not satisfy them. For an appetizer, a warm miso of open data is served, followed by a small pie of third-party data, for the second course a fillet of UGC. To finish, the dessert par excellence: a beautiful meringue of 160 terabytes of copyrighted content.

If he were called to the courtroom, not even Sam Altman himself, CEO of OpenAI, would testify against him, who more than once has raised the need to access copyrighted content to preserve the quality of the training.

So, the dinner is over, but the hunger remains: the only thing to do is to cook again. If new content is missing, the best way is to create synthetic ones to continue feeding the training. The best engineers already know it though: the collapse of this vicious circle is immediate. Since the best-known chatbots, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, are also trained on data acquired through web scraping, it is clear that if the quality of the content on the network worsens - and that same content becomes material for training - the notions learned will be affected. After all, who would want to eat food already chewed by others?

Slop: it is the most used term to indicate low-quality content that floods the servers. The various social platforms try to protect themselves as they can. Reddit with the introduction of paid APIs and the establishment of a task force to moderate synthetic content, or X that declares war on bots by decimating them (but not eliminating them completely). On the other hand, there are those who turn a blind eye (Meta) because in the end let's be clear, shrimp Jesus is hilarious and increases the Time on Site to no end.

So, to sum up:

 - The models have been trained on all human knowledge;
 - As this is not enough, new synthetic content is created;
 - We ourselves generate synthetic content, almost always of very poor quality;
 - All this is re-chewed by the models, in a loop;
 - The quality of the output can only worsen over time.

How can we, therefore, open a new tab on Chrome, look at ourselves in the mirror and promise not to feed this machine? How can we safeguard others from the umpteenth "write a post for LinkedIn that celebrates my achievement, assertive tone, hook at the beginning and CTA at the end"?

Booh! But I can tell you my "5 tricks to differentiate myself and win the attention race in 2025":

 1. Write, write and write with my own head: ChatGPT helps me find references, to delve into some topics, to do proofreading. It's a second brain, but it never writes in my place.
 2. Be myself: as much as I have tried to create a digital clone of myself, I have never been able to make it generate text that truly seems mine. The structure of the sentences, the tone, the irony... there is always something that is not right.
 3. Bring an authentic point of view: In an era where everyone can do everything, the only irreproducible thing is the way we see the world, how we are, what we feel. Telling it, sparingly, is a gentle way of saying "I exist".
 4. Speak little: the precept that I follow is that of the right speech of Buddhism, that is, that the right word must be true, kind and useful.
 5. Use time with care: mine, but above all that of others.

## Anti-slop

If we do not want to perpetuate this furious generate-copy-paste, wear the anti-slop badge too and write and speak as authentically as possible. It will be important for you and impactful for those who read or listen to you. It will be a gentle way to differentiate ourselves from the synthetic and keep alive a weak but genuine flame fueled by us humans.
