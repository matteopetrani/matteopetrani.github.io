excerpt: "We remain relevant if we keep AI on a parallel track to ours, cultivating critical thinking, creativity, sociality and ethics."

An entrepreneur told me: "I want to work to improve the world, so that there is more love and vitality". I believed him.

Work chat, they post a link to a Copilot demo: a dev replicates the Threads UI by chatting with VSCode. For my grandmother who reads me: a guy designs a "site" by talking to the computer.

Then, the message I didn't expect:

> When will Matteos be out of the equation?

Matteos = Interface & visual designers

Two things trigger my synapses.

 1. The sender is a technician, far from being naive. Yet, he still confuses UX with UI. Will it be the eternal curse of designers that we will take to our graves? I can see myself on my deathbed:

"Matte, so you did UX/UI?"
"Fuck you, Johnny"

 2. Tools like Copilot wipe out the grunt work, leaving designers with the role of curators of meaning.

But then: who should seriously worry about their career? Who is saved? But above all, how can we be smarter than the machine?

I had already started a reflection on the topic, talking about why designers can sleep soundly at night; now let's go further.

[Designers are made to last - N°001](/2025/01/29/designers-are-made-to-stay/) – When everything becomes a commodity, the value lies in the humanity that connects the dots.

## Apples and pears

I discover that there are an infinite number of different intelligences. The most renowned are logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal and the most acclaimed emotional intelligence.

The Treccani gets straight to the point:

Intelligence (/in.tel.liˈdʒɛn.tsa/) is the ability to learn from experience, to adapt to new situations and to the environment, to understand and be understood, to manipulate abstract concepts and to use these skills to solve problems and achieve goals.

There are several scales to measure it: the intelligence quotient (IQ), a scale for emotional intelligence (EQ), one for multiple intelligences (Howard Gardner) and others as you please. For machines and AI there are just as many tests and benchmarks, much more operational and with discrete results.

So are we comparing apples with pears? Who is therefore the most intelligent? Man or machine?

There is no answer and, like problems without a solution, the thing is extremely fascinating.

## Parallel tracks

Papua New Guinea, 2023. Francesca approaches me after talking to her uncle, she shows me her hands, parallel to each other and with the palm facing down. She tells me: "A couple works when the two people remain distinct but walk in the same direction, one alongside the other". Nothing could be truer! And it is also a concept that can be transferred to many other areas of our life: without too many forcing, even in our relationship with technology.

Man and AI must walk side by side, without losing the identity of the former or anthropomorphizing the latter. Technology in its form of artificial intelligence must be considered a tool, a sparring partner for an effective and empowering collaboration of our nature, never the other way around. In 1800 we were not worried about the excess of electricity, today we should not be worried about the excess of AI... as long as AI is considered a tool and not a competitor.

If tools like TikTok are enough to wreck our brains and have "brain rot" elected word of the year 2024, how low could we go with an unconditional diffusion of ChatGPT?

From my experience, the path that will best lead us to relive a new renaissance and put man back at the center is the one that forces AI to remain on the parallel track to ours. Unfortunately it must be an imposition, because our fallacious brain really likes the affect heuristic and we would lose our primacy faster than we are already doing.

The affect heuristic is a cognitive mechanism whereby decisions and evaluations are significantly influenced by the emotions that a situation evokes. In practice, when a person has to judge the risk or benefit of an action, they tend to rely on their emotional state rather than on a rational and detailed analysis of the available information, preferring the positive outcome to the negative one.

## Beep beep!

Beep beep was fast, shrewd, creative and moved outside of Euclidean geometry with nonchalance. If AI is our Wile E. Coyote, how can we then be the blue bird and save our skin every time?

### Critical thinking

It is not enough to warn us that "ChatGPT can make mistakes" when the quality of the outputs is so tremendously plausible. On the other hand, questioning every single interaction with machines would deprive our time of meaning. We can get by, however, by refining our critical thinking and focusing on information or actions that have a relevant impact on our life or work.

### Creativity

Without a specific goal or instructions, machines remain motionless. It would be rather interesting to see a computer turn on by itself because it feels like it, or a Tesla that goes for a ride on its own because it wants to see the sunset. We, on the other hand, wake up in the morning with desires, cravings, thoughts and we don't even know why. Our unpredictability is a trait to be cultivated and cared for with love because the unknown is movement, energy and vitality.

### Sociality and emotional intelligence

Can you imagine one day looking a robot in the eye and saying "I love you"? Unfortunately it's not sci-fi, in fact, there are already people who kill themselves for cyber-love. But leaving aside pathological cases, I would say that it is a very unlikely future. We are social beings by nature, endowed with emotional intelligence and with a predisposition to live among our peers. It is another trait not to be overlooked and a virtue that no chip can feel. At most emulate.

### Ethics

Everyone has their own moral principles that regulate their behavior. And this can be a big problem. My ethics are different from those of Tom, which are different from those of Dick. The heterogeneity reflects the richness and diversity of us human beings, but it becomes a business challenge when we have to decide the set of principles and values ​​of an artificial intelligence. We are talking about AI alignment, that is, making sure that machines act in a way that is consistent with our values. But whose values?

We designers are the architects of this alignment and doing so means above all knowing how to adhere to those irrefutable principles, shared by all human beings such as reciprocity, respect for life and honesty.

## Out of the games?

The race for intelligence is popular, both with the S&P 500 and with us early adopters. It is a labyrinth in which only those who know how to waste time questioning themselves will find the exit. Yes, waste time: because while machines optimize, humans diverge. While algorithms replicate, we stop to ask ourselves if a road is worth taking.

As Harari reminds us, "humanity has never won a speed race against technology, but it has always won those of depth". It is not necessary to run faster than AI: it is necessary to dig deeper. In the mystery of that kilo and a half of neurons that we have between our ears, there is space for questions that Copilot cannot formulate: Why this color? Who am I designing it for? What makes this choice ethical, not just efficient?

The "Matteos" will not disappear, but they will transform: from pixel designers to custodians of meaning. Like Beep Beep, we will survive not by ignoring the coyote, but by learning to dance on the edge of the cliff. With chaotic creativity, uncomfortable ethics, and that touch of absurdity that - quoting Minsky - "no algorithm knows how to translate into code".

For this reason, the invitation is to think, act, think and act again: not to compete with machines, but to remind ourselves of what makes us, irreducibly, human.
And even if one day ChatGPT were to design a perfect interface, there is a question to which it will never be able to answer: "Why should it exist?".
