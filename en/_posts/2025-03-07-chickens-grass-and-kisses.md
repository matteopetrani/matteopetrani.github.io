excerpt: "Between chickens in the garden and meetings on Meet, taking time to stay human is the antidote to the 9-to-5 and professional masks."
---

Between CRO campaigns, calls with suppliers, startups and ideas for SaaS, I'm losing pieces while waiting for Noah. The body asks to slow down, the mind pushes to "get ahead". I return to balance when I remember to live.

The colors become warmer, and the eyes relax. Is it the golden hour? A beautiful sunset? Of course not! It's the Mac's Night Shift: it reminds me that the day is drawing to a close and the chickens are still out in the garden.

I say goodbye to some colleagues on Meet, others on Slack, and finally, the most unfortunate ones who still use Teams. They all envy me a little, chickens are a precious asset and happy eggs are a modern luxury. I get off Ulysses, the boat where we live, and take my bicycle. To my right I leave the sea and in 5 minutes I'm in the garden.

Every time I enter the field I bend down and take some grass, a perfect bait to bring the chickens back to the henhouse. It could be the best time to unlock the apps with Touch Grass and do some doomscrolling, but the two steps to get to the enclosure of the ferocious beasts have already made me forget the digital duties that chain me during the day. After all, nature is not a place to visit, it is our home.

Outside the garden fence, work tasks, unanswered emails and AI agents of dubious utility are waiting for me. The moment I re-emerge from this small bubble of nature, my hands will move lazily on the keyboard. Planting radicchio, lettuce and spinach will not make my variants on ABTasty perform better nor increase my clients' sales, but it will certainly relax the diaphragm and give a deep voice.

## How to bring the garden into Meet?

You will have understood that I like to ask questions, so: how can I bring the quality of the garden into my working days as well?

Unfortunately, the bad news is: it is unthinkable to have chickens running around on the desk like you do with cats. Cats can make you smile, true. Chickens, on the other hand, every 3 steps they shit white meringues that if they hit your new Keychron it's over. But we can do something very simple: be human. Whatever that means to you, eh, there is no decalogue to follow. Just show yourself fragile and undecided, but also kind and empathetic. That is, be yourself because everyone else is already taken.

Over the years I have started to take myself much less seriously and to show myself more (a bit like I try to do with this newsletter). It has become easier to admit in front of Heads of, C-levels and others with cringe roles on LinkedIn that "I don't know", "I don't know right now", "you know, I'll do my best to raise my son well", "I want to go for a bike ride and a sail". From "I shoveled shit from the henhouse last night" to "we're looking for a designer, would you like to work with us?" it's a moment. The funnel is shortened, big time.

I am convinced that the moment we strip ourselves of all the masks we wear daily, all the gray of life disappears and what makes us feel good remains. The people who struggle to keep up with you will disappear, invested by a wave of sincerity that they cannot handle. Unpleasant situations will disappear because we ourselves will change them for the better. At the same time, those people and those situations that are made for you will approach. I don't know if I'd call it the law of attraction, but it works.

But I understand that not everyone is ready to show themselves for who we are. First of all, I recommend you do a Vipassana retreat, in Lutirano. Ten days, in silence, without having to prove anything to anyone. Served and revered you just have to breathe for ten days. Nothing else. The reset par excellence.

Then, the question I would ask myself is "If I were to live this moment for the second time, how would I behave?". The movie About Time has one of the covers that least entices me to click on it, yet it is one of the movies that have changed my life the most. Long story short, the protagonist can go back in time and wonders how to use this superpower. Devastating. One of the post-it notes I have stuck at home questions me precisely about this: if we cannot go back in time, we can still think of living as if it were a second time.

## KISS

I've thought for a long time about how to close this newsletter, looking for new ideas and practices to survive the 9to5, but I always come back to what I wrote above. A design principle that I try to adopt often is K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and, especially since I've been living in a few floating square meters, it has mostly become a life principle. You don't need lists of "how to..." to live happily, and in spite of SEO this will be one of the shortest posts I will write.

Stripping away the masks, knowing how to be silent, giving the right value to time.

Now close Gmail and go for a walk on a lawn, come on.
