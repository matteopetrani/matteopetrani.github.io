excerpt: "Life on a boat became home after a slammed door: accepting the storm, lightening up and letting the sea indicate the route."
---

This edition is different from the previous ones, it's about life, it's about changes. Of anchors, of the sea, of sailboats and of storms.

Many of you have asked me to talk about the meaning of living on a boat. If you like these topics, let me know. If you don't like them, let me know anyway.

June 2021. I'm on the landing and I'm looking at the front door. It's closed. Actually, it has just been slammed. In front of my feet there are black bags with my clothes inside. In my pocket I have the keys to the boat. In my head, the greatest confusion.

Have you ever noticed that in the most stressful moments our brain puts on autopilot and knows exactly what to do? The fight-or-flight response could be triggered, a physiological reaction that, in the face of danger, prepares us to fight or flee. Or the brain dissociates: a defense mechanism that partially disconnects us from a difficult reality, relying on instinctive reactions, without a real conscious involvement. As if it had been a birth, I have no clear memories of that moment.

I get in the car and drive slowly to the dock. I get out, walk along the pier to Ulysses. "You will be my new home," I said, giving him two pats on the stern. Although I know every fiber of his fiberglass, every bolt, every noise, thinking that from now on those 10 square meters would become home seemed a decidedly funny scenario.

## Acceptance

> Everything that happens is perfect for us.

There are many escapes disguised as departures: the feeds full of photos of vans and laptops on the beach testify to a modern escapology that has little to do with the love of adventure or discovery. In my case, I didn't need to leave, but to stay. Moored in the silence of a dock, with a routine still to be fixed and a deep work of acceptance to begin.

The boat teaches me to stay: when you sail, in the best of cases, you travel no faster than a marathon runner. There is no escape, except patience, attention and preventing disasters. You stay, wave after wave, with what the sea offers at that moment. Sailing is a school that I wish for everyone: especially for those who suffer from seasickness, for those who cannot stay still, for those who suffer from tight spaces. Few things are as educational as accepting that, sometimes, there is no alternative.

In this new situation - envied by colleagues and friends who exclaimed "Wow, but you live on a boaaat?" - I chose to move light and get as close to nature as possible. On the boat I was left with a smartphone, a laptop, a camera and a few clothes. A parked car and a rusty bicycle. I came into contact with the outside temperature, with the sun and the rain, with the day and the night. I no longer had any contracts, no utilities. Two solar panels are enough to power my devices and 150 liters of water cover a week. It was all I needed to live.

But there was still one thing that kept me anchored to the ground: a certainty, a caress, a chain. A well-paid job in Switzerland.

## Free

Money has never been a problem, and yet it has always been. I have never checked a bank statement: I had enough awareness of how much I spent and earned not to have to do the math at the end of the month. It is simple to achieve this financial serenity: you just need to know how to listen to yourself.

Three quarters of the things we desire - those of "my life will be better if I have..." - are useless. Not only are they useless, but they soon become a burden, physical and mental. How long does post-purchase dopamine last? Boh, a few hours? At most a few days. The same goes for earnings. Listening to yourself serves not only to understand if our professional value is recognized, but also to discover if we are made to accumulate goods or not. And to accept this predisposition. I will come back to this in the future: today, in the era of technology and "move fast and break things", the monetary aspect of our life is far too radical.

Over the years, however, I have been very good at getting myself into a dead end: a high salary in an increasingly toxic company. The serenity of paying the sailmaker without a second thought chained me to a desk (or should I say chart table?) from which I did not want to move away.

It is said that the best sailor is the one who decides to stay in port when there is a storm outside. But to know it, that storm, on some boat he has certainly experienced it. I have never sailed in a storm, neither at sea nor in life. I have been very good at staying moored in my comfort bay, reading the experiences of those who have seen the storm with their own eyes.

Until the universe catapulted me there with kicks. Fired overnight.

The only regret is not having been the architect of the first lighter and freer day of my life.

## Only the waves ahead

In fact, my life has put a period and drawn a line. I asked her: "My life, are you sure?" And she answered me with the sea breeze, new friendships, SUP outings, dinners at anchor, sailing between the islands, new professional relationships, projects at sea. She introduced me to Francesca and I discovered that you can live truly free, even with the duties of a family man.

Succeeding in alternating periods, when I let life do its thing, things always go as they should. In misfortunes, in fortunes. It is all tremendously as I should have expected it, but that I would never have been able to imagine.

To conclude, look at the sea: it is simple, despite being made of 4.5 × 10⁴⁶ water molecules. Isn't life the same? A gazillion different possibilities that materialize in a single story. And then: the boat sails well when the sails are set, the ropes are in order, and the sea is respected. Do you see the analogy? Life runs smoothly when the roots of our thinking are well fed, when our actions respect the limits of nature. From my experience, the best way is to put yourself in a position to see all this simplicity and fall in love with it.

Find your Ulysses, find your Francesca. Cast off the moorings and set the sails well: you will arrive on the lands that belong to you.
