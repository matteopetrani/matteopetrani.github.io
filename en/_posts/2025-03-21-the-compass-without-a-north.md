excerpt: "I stopped following the compass and trusted the sea: letting go of the course opened up new islands, inside and out."

While waiting for Noah to come and rule his ark, I celebrate my first Father's Day, between morning meditations and evening prayers.

The day I stopped staring at the compass, the sea washed me up on the most beautiful islands. I feel more like a magician than a sailor, and this is the story of how I let go and found everything. A story that could also be yours.

## Directions

I thought the compass was my salvation, a needle that would lead me to my destination while time continues to flow. How deluded I was. Giving myself a direction, whether sailing at sea or in life, has not always been the best thing. Now, without opening Pandora's box of those who say "the journey is more important than the destination", the bitter truth is that choosing the direction of each step brings us closer to a goal but precludes us from the possibility of taking other paths. This defines our past and modifies the trajectories of our future. It is also true that, in general, we are all born "magicians": we come into the world as a blank slate, possibly stained by some legacy of our family tree or our Genius Loci, but we tend to have a very large space to design the life we ​​desire. We are a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean, ready to sail for several miles but with easily reachable borders and islands. There is also an escape route, the Strait of Gibraltar which, dodging the orcas (our demons), we can cross to be catapulted into a completely different sea (or life).

I have always sailed safely, I lived from waypoint to waypoint, with a GPS inside my skull. My "I would like" became action, the action a result. I certainly had favorable winds, I recognize that I was lucky in infinite situations, and this has further spoiled my achievement of goals. At 20-21 I had a clear course, I was running on a track of goals that I reached one after the other: work, travel, experiences. But inside something was missing. The intuition? Massacred. The creativity? Sunk. Who cares, right? The impacts before me came on others: friends, partners, family. I became more and more a lone wolf and it is a nature that I still carry within me. I had everything, but I "was" less and less.

## Sinking and re-emerging

In 2017 the first stop, when after 13 meetings with countless different people, at the last interview with Google they told me "thanks but no". The future that, at the time, I desired fades away: moving to Zurich, in a safe, multicultural city, with career prospects and nature just a stone's throw away. Following, a slow cooling of my motivation, especially at work. Years of job hopping begin to snatch a better salary, I broke the routine by flying over the Alps in a glider and the drawer of dreams began to fill up quickly.

Fast forward a few years, I land in Romagna and here things change radically. In a short time I find myself living aboard Ulysses with two magnetic compasses, a Chart Plotter and a VHF (the radio) all pointing north. Yet something explodes. First comes a book, The Universe Has Your Back: devoured on the Kindle, it completely overturned the way I thought about chance, about destiny. For some time, in a completely natural way, I had developed that gut feeling that accompanies me day by day in my choices, but I didn't know how to give it the right weight before each decision. Vipassana then gives me the coup de grace: 10 days of total silence without any dogma, essential to get to see reality better and understand how it works.

And there, among the waves, the heart begins to warm up again. The moment has come when I simply let go of the helm, to see where the current would take me.

## And the sea?

The sea in recent years has been the common factor that has irreparably wet my days. "Those who get wet with salt water never dry up again" I often read, and, at least for me, it was exactly like that.

The sea is a space where you can play with yourself and with nature. A surface where the intentions planned on a chart table become just a suggestion, to be put into a system with forces greater than those we can control. If you have the opportunity to get at the helm of a sailboat for example, you will soon experience how the inputs you give to the helm are just an invitation to the boat to go in a certain direction. You have to compromise with the waves and the winds and renegotiate the course, choosing a new bow that satisfies everyone. Every time I steer is a moment of humility, of total resizing. I, with Ulysses, feel like nothing and at the same time a miracle. My eyes know it well: shiny when in the bay they stare at the Milky Way at night, wide and frightened when I dive in the central Adriatic to see the sun's rays descend into the depths until it becomes dark.

Letting the boat go, trusting its physics, is a modern way of saying "I trust". I trust nature, time, the animal world, myself. Sailing by sight, without getting hurt of course, is a way of affirming oneself free and in tune with oneself and with everything that surrounds us.

And you? When was the last time you let go, that you screamed at life to take you? Write to me, tell me where you went adrift. Or get on Ulysses: the waves are waiting for us.
