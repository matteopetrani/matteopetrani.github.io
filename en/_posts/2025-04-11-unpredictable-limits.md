excerpt: "Becoming a father redefines limits: between impotence, wonder and slow life, the sea and Noah teach us to welcome the unpredictable."

I've been absent for two weeks, "Noah" culpa. I couldn't wait to write again, in this moment so dense and significant. This is a James Joyce-style post, be patient and have fun empathizing with a new dad.

In the kitchen I have reserved a space under a wall unit where I write post-it notes that invite me to reflect. One of them reads "Life happens". The full sentence was meant to be "Life happens, notice it". I left it incomplete because being aware of time and actions must be a choice, not advice from the outside.

In the unfolding of events and experiences, the arrival of Noah is the one that in a more sincere and profound way is reminding me of the essence of life. A quantum field that has entered our temporal parabola and has become a new center of gravity even before being born. It happened by choice, and it manifests the unpredictable and the mystery in every moment.

I could talk about these 10 days of life for thousands of words, but I want to remember above all the sense of limit that I experience every day.

I had already talked about how, at the helm of a sailboat, the course we want to follow is just an intention. This must be agreed upon with the atmospheric agents, the currents and with all the other external factors that indirectly make us sail towards the destination, but along directions that we had not foreseen. As if to say, on the helm there are our hands, but also those of nature and life. And all 6 of them would be well moved in a coordinated way.

[The compass without a north - N°008](/2025/03/21/the-compass-without-a-north/) – Drifting, a simple way to keep wondering.

As a father, what I had experienced at sea, I am experiencing in Technicolor when I am with Noah. Although he is a being completely dependent on us, in the same way we are completely dependent on him.

The suspicion, not very romantic and foretold, is that the father, in these first weeks, is… quite useless. I don't have boobs, and with them I lack 99% of the weapons available to satisfy the physiological needs of this creature (obviously remaining within the perimeter of breastfeeding).

Of course, there is affection, love, cuddles and holding him in a sling warms both our hearts, but when he is hungry and wants the boob, there is no saint that holds. Of all the things I know how to do and say, even the most compassionate ones, there is not one that can satisfy Noah's need (unless I resort to a bottle and formula).

And this tears my heart.

We chose to stay as natural as possible, to fully experience this moment with all the difficulties of the case. No shortcuts then, which in life we ​​know well present the bill sooner or later. It is a return to the origins, stripped of the modern comforts that we gladly leave to others.

If I stop to observe, however, everything is perfect as it is. The choice to live near the sea, to be a little uncomfortable between a boat, a ground-level sofa and a bed mattress as hard as wood. To create without fear and without knowing how to hold a creature in your arms. It is a stupid way for many, but it reminds me that I exist. And yes, everything is tremendously perfect. From the downcast heart when I cannot alleviate Noah's crying, to when I burst into tears watching him fall asleep when I sing him "The walnut tree".

I remember, not without pain, the impassable limits of life. I, an astral traveler, who know how to stay still for days and go down fast on a MTB through the trees, have to measure myself with walking normally. Walking slowly, waiting sometimes, resuming walking with rhythms that are not mine. Sailing had prepared me for many aspects of life, but nothing is like the arrival of a child, even if we feel it as the natural evolution of ourselves.

It is a school, which I hoped would be impactful but I never imagined it would be so profound. And it is perfect like this, in my impotence, in my acceptance of not being able to be different, but of being unique. Also for Noah.
