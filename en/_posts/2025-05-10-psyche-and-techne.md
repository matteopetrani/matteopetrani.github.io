excerpt: "Galimberti teaches that technology does not seek meaning: we can only respond by cultivating consciousness, love and new ways of being in the world."

I haven't written for a while, there weren't enough words to compose paragraphs of meaning. Life fascinates me, it keeps me glued to it, away from keyboards, screens and feeds.

The curtains in the house are dancing again, the windows are open and a warm air with already summer tones is flowing. I'm on the blue sofa at home, made of 4 large cushions arranged on the floor and of all the terrible things I could have done I started reading Psyche and Techne by Galimberti.

A tome of 800 pages, probably a couple of kilos. But I read it on the Kindle, and the only information that reflects the physicality of this book is the 35+ hours to finish reading it. The paragraphs are dense, often to be reread slowly or left to their fate and move on aware of not having understood, confident in the next paragraph.

However, in the first few pages, annoying and dear topics to me are already addressed.

## Technology is full of thieving, malicious and sophistical lupine!

Perhaps we have found a real application of the term Metaverse (do you still hear it out there? I don't, fortunately). Technology, which only at the beginning was a tool in the hands of man, is now the environment in which we live. Not only that, it structures every dimension of our existence. Voila, the metaverse.

We can no longer avoid technology. The world it has created is the world we must inhabit and that, inevitably, has changed us.

From all points of view, technology has become our essence. Compared to animals, which still have instinct, we are biologically lame and only thanks to technology can we survive (yes, I'm also talking about the bow and arrow of the Hadza, of which I leave you a spectacular video). We bipeds with a sapiens brain live only thanks to action.

And here is the small but very big problem that has made technology the solution to all our problems and that has promoted it to a new God.

> Technology is not a derivation of our human spirit, but an extension of our shortcomings.

but even worse

> All the purposes and ends that man proposes to himself cannot be achieved except through technical mediation.

Technology does not seek the good, it does not produce meaning, it does not save. It works and self-potentiates. It has no relationship with the past (which it erases) nor with a meaningful projectual future. It lives in the instant of efficiency.

In this apocalyptic scenario, man no longer feels estranged from the technical system: he identifies with it, thus also losing the consciousness of his own alienation.

## Technology overwhelms you

"Yes, but what about ethics?!?" - the most clamor.

He gives up, celebrates his impotence. Doubting technology would mean killing the possibility of achieving any purpose and meaning. And in this so unbalanced equation, man is in effect only an actuator of the machine. Technology has overcome the previous limits and has made humanistic concepts such as individual, identity, freedom, salvation, truth, meaning and purpose obsolete.

Mocked, I come back down to earth and think about my work first of all, which is as connected to technology as ever. What is the meaning of what I do? TL;DR: apparently a lot, humanly little. I design digital solutions that mediate between men and services, that help companies to scrape together that extra percentage point of conversion and save the asses of some managers, that allow you to find parking at the airport and pay with two clicks. And many other similar projects.

Not being a nihilist, I have learned to confine the emotional discomfort of the absence of meaning, to concentrate on what, in life, truly has meaning: love. As I have already written, in this operating without we have an escape route.

## And yet it's gisbuto

Living without a destination, moving without a precise direction and accepting the uncertainty of the journey is perhaps the greatest stance we have left. The acceptance of one's own limits and the abandonment of the illusion of control and dominion, allows us to live lightly, watering our garden of emotions.

[The compass without a north - N°008](/2025/03/21/the-compass-without-a-north/) – Drifting, a simple way to keep wondering.

Even the good Galimberti in the book The Ethics of the Wayfarer (another brick as smooth as freshly laid asphalt) invites us to recognize the impotence of man in the face of technology and to accept the need to redefine humanistic concepts in the light of the new technical reality. Otherwise, any work risks being a superficial action, incapable of facing the challenges posed by technology.

Looking into the eyes of 1-month-old Noah and trying to figure out how the hell to prepare him for the world, something comes to mind.

### Critical Awareness

Know your enemy: The first step is to become aware of the pervasiveness and nature of technology. Understand that it is not neutral, but that it shapes our way of thinking, feeling and acting. In short, understand the mechanisms of feeds, the attention economy, the dopamine effect, etc., etc.

Asking questions: I believe that philosophy and thought will increasingly come back into vogue, as tools to question the present. Developing a critical thought is the only way not to passively adapt to conventions.

### Soul and love

And let's use these words! May they become more frequent than posts and likes!

Cultivating one's inner garden: Compared to the flowers on the balcony, a miracle of resilience and a will to live despite our doing everything to make them die, our inner garden should be the most flowery, the greenest. We can do this by dedicating time to reflection, introspection, reading, art, music. All activities that nourish the soul and that are devalued by the performative logic of technology.

Returning to feeling: Technology tends to repress or channel emotions into standardized and controllable forms. Learning to "feel" again, beyond superficial stimuli, is our lifeboat. As already recommended N times, go and take a Vipassana course.

Rejection of homologation: Resist the pressure to conform to the models imposed by technology and the market, cultivating one's own authenticity, even if this entails solitude or misunderstanding. In short, I hope that Noah will always be able to recognize himself in the mirror.

From romantic Love to Love as care: we can rediscover love as care for the other, as commitment, responsibility and recognition of his otherness. That unconditional form masterfully described in The Little Prince, aimed only at the other and without asking for anything in return.

### Search for meaning

Returning to asking "Why?": Technology answers the "how" (how to do things more efficiently), but evades the question of "why" (for what purpose?). Let's face it, children are nice at the first why, cute at the second, a pain in the ass at the third. Yet they are masters to be emulated.

Returning to being responsible: Very utopian, but I'll put it anyway. Today, when technology can do everything, returning to being responsible for the long-term consequences can be a way to regain a grip on life and its meaning.

Practicing "Subtraction": Learning to say no, to subtract oneself from the continuous flow of information and stimuli, to create spaces of emptiness and silence to allow the emergence of a deeper thought and feeling. It is not a question of rejecting technology in its entirety (impossible and anachronistic), but of using it consciously and not letting oneself be used by it.

Humanistic Education: I think of my son and the education I would like to pass on to him. Not only technical skills, but also thinking and emotional skills. May he be in nature, in emotions, in silence and in discomfort. May he know how to go beyond calculation and reason, may he know how to give voice to his stomach and his heart.

## And you, do you accept it?

These themes are tremendously dear to my heart. I have gone from being a promoter of technology to a suspicious button-pusher, and I seek dialogue, debate, and study more than ever. If you are interested in these topics, give me a shout =)
