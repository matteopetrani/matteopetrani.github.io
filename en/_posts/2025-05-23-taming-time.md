excerpt: "The only non-reproducible currency is time: taming it means choosing to stop, think and give value to every moment."

The weeks fly by, alas, fast. But dense. Very dense. That yesterday seems like a month ago, that last week is last year. I work a lot, I live a lot.

The other day, I happened to listen to an interview with Paolo Bonolis. How do you end up investing 1 hour of your time listening to Paolo Bonolis? I don't know, but that's how it is. Between one chat and another, however, a few minutes were really deep, we ended up talking about AI and technology. And there, Bonolis said something very intelligent, one of those things that gets stuck in your head and doesn't go away. He touched a raw nerve perhaps, talking about the fact that smartphones are the ready-to-wear solution to all the temporary ills that afflict the modern era. Images, videos, sounds, the perfect refuge for those who don't want to think.

And this reflection was linked, like a wave that follows its previous one, to a film I saw recently: In Time. Attention, very different from that little gem of About Time, which I continue to recommend with all my heart to anyone. No, In Time paints a dystopian future where the current currency is one's remaining life time. An idea that I find extremely fascinating, lucid and inspiring. A concept that, on closer inspection, should not be so far from what we should have well printed in our heads. Indeed, we should question ourselves deeply, we should understand how to make friends with this awareness: the only, true, finite element we possess is time. And on it, we, as human beings, have no potential to control its total quantity.

Matter, on the other hand, yes. The money to buy it, which is itself matter, we can potentially create, we can earn it, we can devise systems so that it enters our pockets (basically, by selling our time). Around us, we see cases that, with a certain superficiality, we would call "successful", but that, to scratch the surface, are simply cases of accumulation of matter. Of little account compared to the beauty of love and the joy of life. All that part there, the material one, is potentially accessible to anyone, with the right strategies, the right dose of luck or, who knows, of courage. Time, on the other hand, no. That is a flow that goes in only one direction, inexorable. And this awareness of our biological finitude should not frighten us, on the contrary. It should be transformed into a gesture of joy, a gesture of thanks for everything that life has offered us and offers us, a reason to give even more value to every single moment.

## Tempus fugit

Now, let's be clear, I'm not here to bore you with the usual rigmarole of "time passing". That, fortunately or unfortunately, we all experience on our skin, every single moment. No, the point that I care about, the one I keep coming back to, is the visceral relationship between thinking, being aware, and the choice, often unconscious but no less deliberate for that, of not being so. And also on this point, I am quite firm and convinced: anyone, I say anyone, has the intrinsic potential to be aware. But thought, that wonderful and complex mechanism, is so entropic, so widespread and so dangerously close to being a self-feeding flywheel, that it represents, by far, the greatest challenge of all time. It is a constant battle.

They have instilled in us, since we were children, that to think you have to stop. But in our ignorant little heads, stopping is already a task in itself, a task that requires a certain type of commitment, a certain dose of mental energy. And so? So, often, it is skipped altogether. Stopping implies not running, and not running implies change, and change implies risk. The risk of not knowing, the risk of not staying updated, the risk of being left out of something, of missing something. And the risk of losing something, alas, is deleterious, because it paralyzes us, it does not make us act. It is precisely what keeps us anchored to our habits, it is what, paradoxically, keeps us in perpetual motion, in a breathless race towards an unspecified "something". It seems that we are always in a hurry, a hurry that consumes us, forgetting that, as the oldest and wisest creatures on the planet observe, plants have no goals, they are there and they wait. We, on the other hand, run, without realizing that perhaps we are just running away from ourselves.

I have tried several times to stop. Literally. Even for ten days in a row, with the intense experience of the Vipassana course. To stop completely, to have nothing else to think about, except my breath. And it is, without a shadow of a doubt, a wonderful, almost miraculous way, to rediscover that sensitivity that is daily anesthetized by the noise of the world. On the other hand, however, I question myself daily, almost obsessively, on how to bring this level of attention into everyday life, how to make it pervasive, how to make my twenty-four hours permeate with this level of attention without necessarily having to isolate myself from the world, without having to "stop" in the literal sense of the term. How to face with awareness, with consciousness, every single moment, even those in motion, the frenetic ones, the ones that seem to slip under the hull of our boat called Life.

### Reduce the noise

And I am convinced, deep down, that it can be done. Yes, it can be done, perhaps with some small, but precious, precautions.
First of all, obviously, and there is no escape here, we must reduce the noise. Drastically reduce everything that is not a signal, everything that is not useful information for us. We are immersed in a continuous din, we have lost the ability to inhabit natural times, the times of the seasons, the silences. And in this din, the very biodiversity of thought, which should be a fundamental need as it is for nature, clashes with a tremendous push for the homologation of Sapiens. It is all too easy to be all the same, to think the same things, to desire the same things, to consume the same noise. And here, a teaching of Buddhism comes to my aid, simple but very powerful: information, to be such, must be useful, true and kind. When even just one of these three adjectives falls, what we have in front of us, I have learned at my expense, is not information, but noise. Pure and simple noise that feeds homologation. So, the first, essential step is to clean up, reduce the noise to keep only what is good, what nourishes, what builds individuality and critical thinking.

### Anchor oneself

At the second point, there is a little trick, a device that can make a difference: that of creating one's own anchor. A firm point to cling to when the tide of thoughts and distractions threatens to overwhelm us. It can be the breath, of course. It can be a physical sensation. It can be a manual action, a repeated movement, something that brings me back here, now, to the present. The breath, in this, is the simplest, the most democratic: we all have it, it is always with us, and it continues its tireless work even when we don't think about it in the slightest. So, finding the habit, building the habit of anchoring oneself to the breath, magically brings us back to the present. And this, mind you, can happen, for example, during a walk, in the middle of a speech, when you are at dinner with friends, at any time. This type of anchor is, in itself, an invitation to think. And here I connect to an idea that is buzzing in my head: if muscle memory exists, why shouldn't the memory of thought also exist? I'm not yet completely convinced of this, but the intuition is strong. When we recall a moment of attention, for example, a moment that reminds us of a meditation practice, then, almost by magic, all those states of concentration and relaxation that used to accompany us, or that we have painstakingly developed, during the phases of meditation, come into play and are recalled. And if you have never meditated... well, maybe it's time to start.

## The digital boats

There are moments, however, and here the matter gets complicated, in which even the awareness cultivated with so much effort is not enough. It happened to me just the other night: everyone asleep, the house wrapped in silence, and me there, awake. And I knew, I knew with an almost painful clarity, that that time there, that gifted time, I could have occupied it by meditating, or by giving thanks for the day that had passed, or simply by reflecting, calmly, on the events. And yet. And yet, I spent it playing a sailing simulator. Little boats. Digital. Mah.

I was aware, perfectly aware, that objectively I was spending my time in an activity of low, very low quality. And yet, I did it. What is the perverse mechanism that led me there, to that choice? I thought about it a bit, and without wanting to over-structure the answer too much, I believe the root was one: forgetting, once again, that time is finite and that it has its own inestimable, unrepeatable value.

And on this subject, I am also quite fed up, if I have to be honest, with all that self-absolving chatter about the fact that "but yes, it's okay like this", "you can give yourself some leisure time", "you can allow yourself some time to fool around", and so on. I believe that this is a distorted narrative, a convenient loophole typical of our hectic and superficial times. I believe it is a fine excuse that we give ourselves not to bear the weight, which is also a responsibility, of the thought that "time is finite". I do not believe at all that this attitude is in our deepest strings. On the contrary, I observe with a touch of envy, I admit, of those who do not allow themselves these continuous moments of distraction, who manage to maintain a firmer focus. They are more energetic, more relaxed, more carefree people in the authentic sense of the term, more alive than me. And this, for me, is a great example, a great spur, a powerful reason for me to commit even more to evaluating time for what it really is: the most precious resource. And to use it to the best of my ability.
Then, let's be clear, I don't want to be a hypocrite: I am the first who, realistically, spends a good third of the day in front of the computer to invoice a few extra K. I am certainly not yet a hermit or a Tibetan monk, far from it. The struggle, in fact, is daily.

And so, I find myself here, at the end of the reflection, with more questions than answers, perhaps. But with the certainty that this seasickness that keeps us united, deserves all our attention, all our care. The challenge is immense, but perhaps, precisely in recognizing it, in talking about it, in sharing these stumbles and these small illuminations, there is already a first step to reappropriate a life a little more lived. Because, as an immortal verse that resonates with incredible force even today reminds us, "You were not made to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge." Here, perhaps this is the whole question: to use our time, this finite and inestimable gift, not to drown in noise and haste, but to cultivate inner virtue and knowledge of the world and of ourselves.

Until next time!
