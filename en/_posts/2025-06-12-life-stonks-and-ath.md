excerpt: "The obsession with eternal growth betrays the fear of death: between myths and rebirths, we need to re-embrace cycles, pain and normality."

I haven't written in a while. The more than two hours to give birth to a piece have been deliberately spent with family, observing each other and smiling at each other. It can happen :)

It's 2025, and everything has to grow. Followers, likes, views. Progress, technology, the number of parameters of the umpteenth LLM. Friendships, love for one's partner, family. Despite the widespread shrinkflation (a trick to make revenues grow), there seems to be no other way than to grow. I'M ITCHING.

I grew up in companies that "we have to do +20% next year, otherwise we'll die", and yet we're still doing well today. Is it necessarily a bad thing, after all, to die? Why is ending up in the organic waste bin so scary?

The other day I came across a reflection by Joseph Campbell, one who wrote a couple of lines on myths, and he says:

> "Only birth can conquer death - the birth of something new. In order to survive, a 'continuous birth' must occur in the soul, in the social body, which nullifies the incessant work of death".

"A continuous birth", not a continuous growth, but a rebirth. A bit like when we wake up every morning, in short.

Speaking of myths, a world opens up, which is nothing more than a reflection of the gods we worship. You will remember from some high school book that there was a Homeric era in which the gods were the incarnation of the unity of everything, of the fact that opposites not only coexist but hold hands: life and death, strength and fragility, light and shadow. A duet that moved the universe. And the myths? Well, the shrewd Odysseus, the warlike Achilles were heroes yes, but with all their human cracks in plain sight. Moved by the hands of the gods, every action of theirs was justified and justifiable, because it was a manifestation of the divine project they embodied. Wonderful. Everything was lawful, everything was sacred. In those times, the underlying concept of everything was rebirth: from death comes life, from withering a new flowering. We were part of a cycle where gods and nature dictated the laws, not us.

And in the post-Homeric era? Embrace immortality. The gods have become a tool to divide: on the one hand the divine, the good, the just; on the other the demonic, the ugly, the bad. The blackboard with a line in the middle when the teacher is absent: on one side the good guys, on the other the bad guys.

The myths, consequently, have changed. Worlds-beyond-the-world have sprung up, from paradise to the metaverse, safe havens against the suffering of the real. We have shaped new superheroes with halos, immaculate figures who teach us to wait for the miracle of eternal life in a continuous improvement of ourselves until the final judgment. And the underlying concept of everything has become growth. Long live life! Shoo shoo to death. Win, win, win and woe to end up among the defeated. Rationality, identity, the I with a capital "I" to dominate everything, including the world.

That's right, it's our era.

Everything, but absolutely everything, must grow to make us feel fulfilled. But growth, if you think about it, presupposes a constant escape from what we leave behind. What is measurable must grow and also what has no scale: the growth syndrome also affects relationships. How many couples find themselves asking "Where are we going? Why aren't we growing?", manifesting that typical discomfort of those who live under the spell of the post-Homeric god of growth.

Ok cowboy, growing is fundamental in a thousand aspects and makes us live objectively better. The real problem is that everlasting growth does not exist. It is a myth, in fact. A myth that betrays a deep, almost infantile, horror of mortality. All this craving for amortality, for longevity at all costs, for fake noses and misshapen lips, for augmented reality, are the symptoms of an era that does not know how to come to terms with its own shadow. Every crack, every fear, is promptly covered with a fresh coat of paint of enthusiasm for novelty. Every year is the best yet, woe otherwise.

We don't know what to do with pain, death, defeat. We can't give it a role, a meaning. And so? And so we grow, we run, in a perennial escape towards a promised land that, I fear, does not exist.

Viktor Frankl, one who had known pain up close in the Nazi camps, left us a very powerful lesson:

> "If a concrete destiny inflicts pain on man, he must also see a task in pain".

To be present in one's own pain, not to flee it, to give it a meaning. New Age, right?

I wonder when (rather than if) it will be time to talk about death and pain to Noah. Who knows when he will be able to see rebirth and life in it. When he will be able to remind me that entertainment and leisure are just an escape on the spot. I will tell him a poem by Borges, "John, 1, 14", to give him the strength to stay. He rewrites the beginning of the Gospel of John, but he has God speak in the first person and comes out with a verse that struck me:

> "Sometimes I think with nostalgia / of the smell of that carpenter's shop".

The smell of Joseph's workshop. the Almighty is nostalgic for such a trivial, so human detail.

Borges is telling us "Hey man, look, the normality of your life, the one made of smells, of repeated gestures, of insecurities, of death and limits is the envy of God!". Yes, the same normality that we, blinded by growth, have tried to escape. And this has concrete consequences, such as the generational clash - those who get old do not leave space - or the demographic crisis. If you think you will live forever, or you delude yourself that you can do it thanks to some amazing technology, why should you bring children into the world, who will inevitably remind you that your time is about to end and that someone else will take your place? It is better to invest in oneself, in one's own well-being, in one's own (illusory) longevity.

And so, what better time to stick our noses out of this current that is dragging us away? What better time to stop, make friends with our deaths and walk aware that the destination exists, it is certain and we will all embrace it? What better time to look life in the face, standing still, without necessarily growing?
