excerpt: "Between marriage, near-burnouts and hyper-digital teenagers, scattered notes to stay grateful, present and connected to what matters."

Fresh from my wedding and a week away from screens, I return with my head bowed to type and live with grace. 24/7 with Noah and Francesca, a rare fortune.

Four weeks without writing: this too is being in the age of technology. To move my fingers and put my thoughts in order, this article will be a Joyce's Ulysses. More than anything, a surrogate of it. Let's begin.

I finished reading The Word to the Young by Umberto Galimberti. A cold shower of nihilism to which one tries to give an answer with Greek thought. A reading that I recommend to everyone, because there is some trace of latent adolescence in all of us. We know that Gen Z is not doing well, and yet there is always a way out.
Among my neighbors there is a group of teenagers who, in the evening, sit on the bench outside the entrance, smoke and scroll for hours without talking to each other. Brain and physical death guaranteed.

In this regard, I am participating in a wonderful initiative of the Porto4 law firm to raise awareness on the subject: where is the border between real and digital? And then, what is cyberbullying? What role does privacy play in the life of a fifteen-year-old? Themes apparently light years away and complex, to be made accessible to an audience that speaks a different language from mine.
A beautiful challenge as a designer, perhaps the project that finds me most unprepared.

In these weeks I have had to do with teenagers of all ages, found by chance at the table during a dinner between friends and families. These are themes that they totally ignore. Their digital self is more important than the real one: it comes before the body, before everything else. It is a complex and sharp theme, as only adolescence in 2025 can be.

A project with a meaning and of meaning I have talked a lot with friends and entrepreneurs. After having brushed against a burnout, where for weeks my mind was totally foggy already at 10 in the morning and tears came down suddenly in the evening, chance led me to talk about "why" with people I respect. Why do we work in a certain way? Why do I organize my time as I am doing? Can I do better? I have been a father for three months: am I happy with how I participate in family life?

What questions do you ask yourselves most often?

In my circle of friends, leaves scattered by the wind around the world, I have several pole stars that help me answer my Hamletic doubts: Michele, Luigi, Nicolò, Roberto, Giovanni, Davide, Lorenzo, Nicola.
The brightest, Francesca, is also the strongest and most patient.
I realize that all of these, like me, are of few words. A message, a look, a silence are more than enough to make me feel that they are holding out their hand to me, without asking, without ego, with love. I hope to be of equal value to them too.

Planted within a 30' radius of Rimini, I am - not without difficulty - beginning to appreciate what is close instead of always desiring what is far away. It is true: we are a society founded on lack (real or induced as it may be), where desire is everything. To desire what one does not have, how beautiful!

Here, in this turmoil I find it hard to remember to practice gratitude. Easy with what is clearly a fortune (like my family), difficult with the little things that escape over time.

And so: family dinners are welcome, when someone knocks on your door and you don't know who it is, spending time at the table with long-time friends of whom, unfortunately, you still know little. And to thank.

## Scroll my thoughts

I bought some tarot cards, not for divination, but to study symbology and archetypes. They are a particular alphabet very useful for understanding oneself and for reflecting. A fascinating and enriching world to remind us that we are not only alpha, but also omega.

Doing, and then observing children, is good for us: it reminds us to be a little more alive.

Resuming training after four years of only yoga is a birth.
Although I practice the most dynamic variants (which enjoy outlandish adjectives like rocket, power and the like), apart from handstands I can no longer do anything that requires a minimum of strength.
Don't be fooled either: stay active and do cardio.

I was told that it is impossible for the annual costs of a 12-meter sailboat like Ulysses to be lower than those of a 500 Abarth (with 10,000 km of annual mileage).
And yet... it is so.
Buy a boat, not a sports car.

The episode of The Filament where Bariselli interviews Silvano Agosti is something wonderfully simple and profound. 30 minutes well spent to dust off the soul.

I wanted to reactivate my Freeletics subscription, but it was more interesting to recreate the coach on Gemini AI. A good system prompt and a handful of ad hoc sources for creating personalized workouts have given life to a not bad personal trainer.

Two weeks later I subscribed to Freeletics.
It is clear that the data of 56 million customers are much more solid than the theory and literature swallowed by an LLM.
Every time I am surprised at how easy it is to overestimate the capabilities of AI.

I have just paid €30k in taxes, but thanks to the good Paolo Coletti and the pillar system, I had planned everything and that figure was not eroded by inflation.

The same Paolo Coletti made a beautiful video on FIRE, which heavily dampened the enthusiasm for going on vacation early. It takes another 10 years of work to ensure a 98% probability of living on an income and leaving something to Noah.

If the Kindle suffers from battery drain, it is likely that it has stalled indexing some books. Delete and re-download the latest books, or do the infamous factory reset. It works.

I have read:

 - [Resurrecting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40658304-resuscitare) by Igor Sibaldi: a beautiful point of view on the Gospels and on a reading of them devoid of "Church", with a particular focus on time, for us linear but not necessarily so.
 - [The theory of everything told by you](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52666431-la-teoria-del-tutto-raccontata-da-te?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=7x2kveolGQ&rank=1) by Igor Sibaldi: explains how we are the architects of our reality.
 - [The Word to the Young](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37783113-la-parola-ai-giovani?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_20) by Umberto Galimberti

Magical places

 - B&B Desiata, Pietracuta: a corner of paradise. Three rooms, swimming pool for exclusive use, home restaurant. It seems to be guests of one's grandparents.
