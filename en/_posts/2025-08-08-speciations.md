telegram: "I often wonder how to embrace error, how to be Martians in this land of conformists. I talk about it in the last article."
excerpt: "When everything appears normal and static, the only way to evolve is to ask 'What if...?', embrace error and cherish one's own being Martian."

A week in theme with the thoughts I am about to tell you. We talked about the future, new initiatives, creating but also slowing down and finding a rhythm again.

Take a good look at yourself, for a moment. Where are you? What thoughts do you have? What kind of life do you live? But above all: do you feel you belong to a species, or do you feel like a Martian?
«Martian!», you will say. Look outside: unless you live immersed in mother nature, you would want to say «shoo shoo» to this rickety and limping world. «I don't identify with that!», I often say to myself too.

There is a fundamental problem that keeps me anchored. Thoughts, technology and general culture have gone too far from where they should be. This gap from the natural time of things makes the norms and values ​​that we recognized as valid fall. «Fantastic: ChatGPT now entertains my son during car trips», I read on LinkedIn. Parents proud of no longer being so. Then I think of the empty churches, of the families emptied of traditions and values, of the cries of the fathers that come out of the houses of the nearby buildings.

And yet everything seems normal.
Our centers and principles of authority have weakened. Those who remain hold their place with force, not with the heart.

When everything becomes normal, nothing is different; nothing surprises, nothing attracts. There are no reasons to be different. The result is immobility: in comfort and safety, reason navigates without stress.
«But how, Matte! I can't take my job anymore, coming home late with four cents in my account!» True. And yet that job, those four cents and that whirlwind of balls we all keep for at least a year, because otherwise it dirties the CV.

Our mind, which works a lot when there is work to be done and little when we rest, remains anchored to reason. It has become technical too. Reason leads us, quickly, to our goals, and this increases self-esteem. How can you not respect yourself? You would be out of your mind, right?

As if that were not enough, to reinforce the idea that all in all it is better to stay quiet in one's own, there is an avalanche of apocalyptic content: woe to think about tomorrow. No no, it is better to make the current conditions last, forever, and not spend energy to imagine a different future.

## What if...?

But two words are enough to dismantle everything: «What if…?»
It is a magic formula that creates a void in front of us. The full is known, the void is not. With the void, bewilderment, fear, but also openness are born. New programs are born, without yet visible horizons, which leave a blank canvas for imagination and creation. Opening the doors to a different future is a form of generosity towards the species: a gift, a novelty.

And if… I were stupid? Stupidus, in Latin, comes from stupere: to be dazed, frozen. Let's say «he who stands still», in essence: he who stops asking himself questions.
«Whoever tries to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses it will save it» (Lk 17:33). I paraphrase it like this: whoever tries to save his psyche, loses it; whoever loses it, generates it.

Psiché in Greek means soul, life, mind. The stupid lives on the basis of what he knows; consequently he models his mind on certainties. Such a mind can only limit the soul, our highest idea of ​​ourselves.

He who knows is lost. He who knows assigns value to things. He who knows says:
the world
the truth
the work
the God
the life
the money.

Instead, the «What if…?» say:
a world
a truth
a job
a God
a life
…

«The» is stability; «a» is dynamics. It is putting to the test what we knew until today.
And even stronger: I vs an I.
«I want, I think…» becomes «a part of me wants», «a part of me thinks». Everything changes, right?

It is the way to evolve: to leave the mother species and bud elsewhere. A liberation, a contortionism to get out of the known and open up to the unknown, as if we were unwrapping ourselves, like a candy.

With the unknown will come mistakes, of course. The fear of making mistakes is strong because it eliminates the distance from our convictions and our knowledge. What is a zero distance, if not a warm and safe embrace, that makes us fall asleep peacefully? Or is it a limit to be overcome?

Only in mistakes are we ourselves; only in mistakes do we have the opportunity to know ourselves, to experience that much-desired newness. In error everything becomes discovery and courage.

To lose ourselves to find ourselves again. It is the only miracle available. And what if to succeed we needed to cherish our being Martians, that small shift from the ordinary that opens the door to the new?
