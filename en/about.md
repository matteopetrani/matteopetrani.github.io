*[Looking for my CV?](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteopetrani/https:/)*

-

I was born in Friuli when the radioactive clouds of Chernobyl were wandering through Europe, but I grew up healthy, just a little bald.

I grew up in a family that was all in all healthy, sweet, with good principles. The past life has been quiet, without shocks.

I fell in love with design thinking, but I'm only discovering its essence since I put my head straight. Ambassador of all technological inventions, for a few years now **something has been cracking**.

I think a lot, I talk little: what is the role of man in relation to technology? How does it change us? What is the point of designing and living as a designer today?

**I try to find out by doing, living, telling.**
