[Product designer, CRO specialist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteopetrani/) & Noah's father.

I am a designer with over 14 years of experience in transforming a vision into concrete results, working on SaaS platforms, ecommerce and digital services. Specialized in **CRO** and **systemic design**, I combine the rigor of engineering with attention to detail, edge cases and the "why" that guides every design choice.

After experiences in [H-Farm](https://www.h-farm.com/ithttps:/) and [Sketchin](https://sketchin.com/https:/), today I work as a **freelance** with companies that want to improve the user experience and increase conversions through A/B testing and UX design.

I believe in a holistic approach that integrates people, business and technology. I collaborate only when there is a good fit, with clear, essential and measurable results-oriented processes. I am mainly interested in generating real and demonstrable impact.

**I'm always open to a chat to understand your company's needs: [book here](https://cal.com/matpet).**
